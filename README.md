# Clocky - An Overlay Clock Widget
Clocky is a dead simple clock application developed using Python and Tkinter. I created it to have an overlay clock widget on my computer that displays the current time so I don't lose track of it. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds with an AM/PM indicator. The clock updates itself every second and is positioned at the top-right corner of the screen as an overlay widget.

## Requirements
Clocky requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter module to be installed. If you don't have Python or Tkinter installed, you can download the pre-built Windows executable file (`Clocky.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/spignelon/Clocky/releases/latest) and use it standalone without installing anything else.

## Usage
Running as a Python script
To run Clocky as a Python script, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where clocky.py is located. Then run the following command:
```
python Clocky.py
```

## Using the standalone executable
To use the standalone executable, download the Clocky.exe file from the [latest release](https://github.com/spignelon/Clocky/releases/latest). You can then run it by double-clicking on the file. The standalone executable doesn't require you to have Python or Tkinter installed on your computer.

## Release
The latest release of Clocky includes a pre-built Windows executable file (`Clocky.exe`) that you can use standalone without installing anything else. To download the latest release, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/spignelon/Clocky/releases).
